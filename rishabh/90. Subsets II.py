notice the base conditions 
APPROACH - 1
according to your binary tree you'll find the ans at leaf nodes
hence idx reaching end is imp, not the len(curr_path)
                []
              /    \
           /          \
          1              []
        /  \            /  \
      2     []        2     []
      /\    /\        /\    /\
     2 []  2  []     2 []  2  []



APPROACH - 2
every unique node is an answer if draw a left skewed tree
where at every node you can only have branches forward
eg:       []                ` denotes unique nodes
        / | \
       /  |  \
      /   |   \
    1`    2     2`
   /\    /
  2  2`  2`
 /
 2`

Better - skip duplicate branches, no set()
APPROACH - 3
eg:       []                ` denotes unique nodes
        / | \               X denotes skipped branch
       /  |  \
      /   |   \
   [1]`  [2]`   X
   / \    |
[1,2]` X  [2,2]`
 /
[1,2,2]`

    I- List [int]
     - duplicates , repeated
     - -ve, 0, +ve
     - 1 to 10

    O - all possible subsets, but not repeated

    [1,2] => {[], [1], [1,2] == [2,1]}

    APPROACH:
        sort the input first to eliminate duplicate tuples
        and use same approach as subset, just use set() to eliminate duplicates
        
        2 IMPLEMENTATIONS:
        1: complete binary tree
        2: left skewed tree, use set instead of skipping duplicate 
Better- 3: left skewed tree where every node is an answer, skip duplicate branches, no need of set
