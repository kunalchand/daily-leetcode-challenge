Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. 
'#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
