Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
Example 2:

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
